        <p class="heading"> Keeping Hopes: Pant On Course For IPL Return</p>
        <p class="news-2">Rishabh Pant remains on course for a much-anticipated comeback in the IPL after taking part in a practice game organised by his franchise Delhi Ca
            pitals in Alur, Karnataka. Pant, who met with a horrific car accident in December 2022, has been undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy and is
             working hard to regain match fitness before the start of the IPL.The southpaw had also featured in an exhibition game last year. “The match was part of assessing
              his mobility basically. He has been batting at nets for a while and playing in a practice game was more like an extension of it,” said an NCA source referring to
               the intra-squad game in Alur near Bengaluru. Earlier this month, Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting had given a major update on Pant, saying the cricketer was 
               confident about his return in the IPL. However, Pant may not be ready for wicketkeeping duties in the competition, as suggested by Ponting at an event in Melbourne.
               “Rishabh is very confident that he’s going to be right to play. In what capacity we’re not quite sure yet,” Ponting had said. “You would have seen all the social me
               dia stuff, he’s up and about and running well. But in saying that we’re only six weeks away from the first game as well.e like an extension of it,” said an NCA source referring to

               dia stuff, he’s up and about and running well. But in saying that we’re only six weeks away from the first game as well. So we’re not sure if we’ll get wicketkeeping
                out of him this year. But I’ll guarantee if I asked him now he’ll say, ‘I’m playing every game, I’m keeping every game and I’m batting at No. 4’. That’s just what he’s
                 like, but we’ll keep our fingers crossed,” he added. Pant is also expected to lead Delhi Capitals. David Warner had captained in his absence last year. “He’s such a dynam
                 ic player. He’s obviously our captain. We missed him incredibly last year,” Ponting said. “If you understand the journey he’s been on the last 12-13 months, it was a horrific
                  incident. One that I know he feels very lucky to have even survived, let alone have the chance to play cricket again. We’ll just keep our fingers crossed and hope that he can
                   be out there and play. Even if it’s not all the games, if we can manage him through 10 of the 14 games or whatever that might be then will be a bonus,” he had said. — PTI</p>

        <p class="heading-3">NEW LEVEL UNLOCKED</p>
        <P class="news-4"> The Indian men’s hockey team began its Paris 2024 Olympics campaign with a 3-2 win against New Zealand in Pool B at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir on Saturday
            . Mandeep Singh (24’), Vivek Sagar Prasad (34’) and Harmanpreet Singh (59’) scored the goals for India while Sam Lane (8’) and Simon Child (53’) got on the scoresheet 
            for the Black Sticks. India, ranked seventh in the world hockey rankings, began the match with purpose and almost took the lead five minutes in after Abhishek nicked
             possession at the edge of the New Zealand penalty circle, drove in and let one rip. It took a brilliant save from Black Sticks goalkeeper Dominic Dixon to keep the
              scoreline level. However, it was world No. 10 New Zealand who drew first blood in the contest against the run of play. Eight minutes into the first quarter, a high 
              stick from an Indian defender saw the referee award the first penalty corner of the match to the Black Sticks. Sam Lane’s powerful drag flick, hard and low, had Ind
              ia’s veteran goalie PR Sreejesh rooted to the spot and rattled the board. The goal changed the complexion of the game as New Zealand looked more assured on possessio
              n and managed to control the tempo. Manpreet Singh’s mazy run towards the end of the quarter created yet another goal-scoring opportunity for India but his driven cr
              oss across the goal didn’t find a finishing touch. The second quarter got off to an edgy start as New Zealand skipper Nic Woods was sidelined for five minutes as the
               Black Sticks came out with an extra player on the pitch. India sought to capitalise on the one-man advantage and almost did through Sukhjeet Singh but Dixon was the
               re to spoil the party yet again. However, India did find a way through midway through the quarter after winning back-to-back penalty corners. Dixon managed to kee
               p Harmanpreet Singh out from the first and seemed to have done it again from the follow up. However, Mandeep Singh was at hand to sweep in the rebound the second 
               time to bring up his 117th international goal. The half-time hooter sounded with the teams square at 1-1. The third quarter got off to an emphatic fashion with
                Dixon and Sreejesh called on to make decisive saves at either end. India, however, managed to edge ahead after a goalmouth melee in the 34th minute. After another
                 superb save from Dixon, the ball fell in a crowd of sticks inside the New Zealand circle and it was Vivek Sagar Prasad who found the decisive nick to get the ball 
                 past the goalline. The fourth quarter saw both teams throw caution to the wind with New Zealand going for the equaliser and India trying hard for an insurance 
                 goal. It made for some fantastic attacking hockey and some stunning saves from Sreejesh and Dixon, particularly the latter. With seven minutes left on the clock, 
                 it was a well-worked indirect penalty corner routine which brought New Zealand back level. Veteran campaigner Simon Child produced a brilliant finish to beat 
                 Sreejesh and set up a scramble to the finish line. Just as it seemed the match was headed for a draw, India won a penalty stroke after a New Zealand foot stopped a Harmapreet
                  penalty corner from going in. The Indian skipper stepped up under pressure and converted what would be the winning goal in a thrilling match. India will face Rio 2016 
                  champions Argentina in their next Paris 2024 Olympics hockey match on Monday.</P>
